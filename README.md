## Project explanation

This project is a single page where there are several posts injected using JS.
All the data are inside an initial array and through functions with the template litteral I can insert the Html into the page.
Foreach cycle has been used to create al the article cards.
The Map method allows me to populate a support empty array with all the existing tags.
String manipulations methods are applied on tags and the data format to show them as I wished. 
Added the chance to filter the post by their tags or by their status (saved or not saved).
The filter works with both the conditions active and it has been handled with several conditionals (if/else).
